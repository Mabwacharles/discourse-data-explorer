-- Itâ€™ll require a little bit of modification to your exact setup. Add or remove the series of 5 lines which look like this:
-- MAX(CASE ucf.name WHEN 'user_field_1' THEN value END) AS first_field
-- to your exact number of custom fields (if you need more than 5, then add a line with user_field_6, user_field_7, etc.). 
-- You can also change first_field/second_field/etc. to a more descriptive name of what the field contains.
